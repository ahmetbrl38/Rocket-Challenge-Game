# :rocket: Rocket Challenge Game

This is a Rocket Challenge game designed and developed in Unity. There are 5 levels in the game. It is very simple to play and basic to start. This game served me understanding more than basics of Unity such as changing scenes,fail,restart.

###  :sassy_man: Explanation:

⇒ Try to let the rocket pass obstacles without touching till the end point. You're gonna need to try again if you hit any obstacle. If you successfully reach to end point,you can pass the next level. At the end of last level,game is going to restart automatically.

###  :sassy_man: Game Design:

⇒ Player Experience: Precision,Skillful

⇒ Core Mechanic: Skillfully fly spaceship and avoid environmental hazards.

⇒ Core Game Loop: Get from A to B to complete the level. Then progress to next level.
